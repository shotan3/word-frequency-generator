## Word Frequency Generator

This is a personal project that utilizes a Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm to crawl through Wikipedia pages and record the frequencies of words. Currently, the program is single-threaded, but it will soon be updated to utilize multithreading for increased efficiency.

The resource folder contains the following files:
1. `cache/already-visited-pages.txt` - this file stores the URLs of the pages that the program has already processed.
2. `stats/word-stats.txt` - this file contains the end-product of the program execution, which is a list of words and their frequencies sorted in descending order. This file is pre-populated with 10,000 entries.
3. `words/words.txt` - this file contains approximately 59,000 English words in alphabetical order. It is used to validate that the words found on Wikipedia pages actually exist.

The first two files were generated by the program, which visited 10,000 Wikipedia pages and stored the frequencies of each encountered word. The last execution took 57 minutes, but adding more threads will significantly reduce the processing time.

The list of English words was downloaded from this link: http://www.mieliestronk.com/wordlist.html
